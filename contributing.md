Before you begin, please review and adhere to our national organization's [Code of Conduct](https://codeandcoffee.org/code-of-conduct). We expect all contributors and community members to treat each other with respect and create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone.

## Getting Started

## Contributing

### Issue Tracking

We manage our tasks and track bugs, features, and enhancements using our issue tracker. These tasks will contain one of the two labels: Community or Website Team. 

Community tasks are open for any member of the Code and Coffee community who would like to make a contribution to this project. Check out our open [communinty tasks](https://github.com/CodeandCoffeeCommunity/boston-code-and-coffee/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acommunity+is%3Aopen).

Website Team tasks are restricted to the team of volunteers who are part of this project. If you would like to become a volunteer of the Boston Code and Coffee chapter, please reach out to one of our organizers.

Before starting to work on a new task, check the issue tracker to ensure someone else isn't already working on it. If you find an issue you'd like to work on, comment on it to express your interest and get assigned to it.

### Finding and Working on Tasks

If you're looking for a task to contribute to, you can find issues tagged with labels like "good first issue" or "help wanted." These are suitable for newcomers and contributors looking to make an initial impact.

### Pull Requests

When you're ready to submit your contribution, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name related to the task (e.g., `feature/issue-123` or `bugfix/issue-456`).
3. Make your changes, committing in logical and smaller steps.
4. Write clear and comprehensive commit messages.
5. Push your changes to your forked repository.
6. Open a pull request to the main repository's `main` branch.

### Code Review

All contributions undergo a code review process. Be open to feedback, and address any comments or suggestions made during the review. This helps maintain code quality and ensures that the project's standards are upheld.

## Style Guidelines

### Documentation

All code changes should be accompanied by appropriate updates to the documentation. This includes code comments and [CHANGELOG.md](changelog.md) file.

## Community and Communication

### Communication Channels

Join our community and engage with other contributors and users on our discord server: [Code and Coffee Community](https://www.codeandcoffee.chat).

### Getting Help

If you need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out on our discord server linked above. Our community is friendly and supportive, and we're here to help you succeed.
